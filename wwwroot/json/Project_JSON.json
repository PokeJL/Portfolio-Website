        "Description": "As anyone can create a ROM hack it has been deemed impractical to develop a SAV file editor as various aspects of a SAV could be modified resulting in a lot of edge cases and constant updates to support new ROM hacks. By editing the RAM checksum calculations and data block management can be handled by the game itself mitigating data corruption.",
